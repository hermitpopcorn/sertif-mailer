# Sertif Mailer

## What does it do?

It creates certificates and then mails them.

## What does it do, but gutai-teki ni?

By feeding it some data, you can automate the creation of e-certificates and also sending them via mail.

The e-certificates are either made by drawing text on a base image file and then putting it in a PDF, or plastering text on a pre-made base PDF file.

Then they get mailed via Gmail. The entire OAuth2 stuff is pretty complicated and I'm not even sure what exactly happens.

## Why?

Because my teacher asked me to, but no way in hell I'm going to make and send 600 certificates manually.
